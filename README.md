# Detecting Breast Cancer

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer in high density breast tissue with mammogram images.


If you are beginning with .dcm files, start with the Convert_dicom_to_png.py file to convert the dicom image(s) to png. The data is loaded in png format initially.

You can run python ResNet50_Wt.py through any of your environments. You will need the following files:

--Convert_dicom_to_png.py----(Optional)

--MammoData.py-----------(required)

--ResNet50_Wt.py---------(required)

The following dependencies are needed to run the required programs.

## Getting Started

In  a terminal window, enter python Convert_dicom_to_png.py -dicomPath(or dir) -pngPath(or dir). Include the -f flag for folder conversions. Convert_dicom_to_png.py -f -dicomdir -pngdir.

-Replace the necessary directories in MammoData.py with your own. We recommend working with "INBREAST" contains high quality images with the relevant Metadata.

-Replace the initial length variable with the split of your choice. It is currently set as 0.7. Make sure to change it at line 94 to reflect the new split as well.

-In ResNet50_Wt, only necessary changes are optional. They include the learning rate, batch size and num_epochs. Scroll to line 244 to access these variables.
